## The Problem

- Lack of clarity on which AI model is best for each task or field
- AI pricing is inconsistent and scattered across many sources
- No unified, up-to-date catalog for new and existing models
- Developers waste time manually comparing or testing models
- Businesses risk overspending due to lack of alternatives visibility

## The Solution

The AI Commerce Store is a unified platform that:

- Maps, organizes, and compares AI models by:
  - Model capabilities
  - Field (vision, NLP, audio, code, agents, etc.)
  - Performance metrics
  - Price per 1M tokens / per request
  - Provider (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, etc.)
  - Release date and deprecation status
  - Benchmarks
  - Supported languages, modalities, and input/output formats

## User Value

Users can quickly answer:

- "Which model should I use for X?"
- "What’s the cheapest equivalent to Y?"
- "What’s the best model for image + text multimodal?"

## Platform Vision

- To be the authoritative source for AI model discovery, pricing, and benchmarking
- To empower developers, businesses, and researchers to make informed, cost-effective choices
- To provide transparent, up-to-date, and actionable data for the AI ecosystem
