1. The Problems

* People don’t know which AI model is best for each specific task or field.
* AI pricing is inconsistent and scattered across many websites.
* Companies release new models frequently, but there’s no unified, up-to-date catalog.
* Developers waste time comparing models or manually testing them.
* Businesses risk overspending because they don’t know cheaper or better alternatives.

2. The Solution

A platform that maps, organizes, and compares AI models by:
    * Model capabilities
    * Field (vision, NLP, audio, code, agents, etc.)
    * Performance metrics
    * Price per 1M tokens / per request
    * Provider (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, etc.)
    * Release date and deprecation status
    * Benchmarks
    * Supported languages, modalities, and input/output formats

This allows users to quickly decide:

    “Which model should I use for X?”
    “What’s the cheapest equivalent to Y?”
    “What’s the best model for image + text multimodal?”
