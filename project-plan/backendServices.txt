A. Model Catalog

    Purpose: 
        Provide a complete, always-updated list of AI models across providers.

    Core Data for Each Model:

        Name, provider, release date, deprecation status

        Fields: vision, NLP, code, audio, multimodal

        Supported input/output formats

        Languages supported

        Price (per token, per request)

        Metrics & benchmarks

        Capabilities summary

B. Pricing Engine

    Purpose: 
        Centralize price information and allow comparisons.

    Logic:

        Store pricing per provider/model

        Normalize cost into unified metrics (e.g., price per 1M tokens)

        Calculate cost equivalents:
        “What’s cheaper but similar?”

        Support filtering by cost range

C. Capability Matching

    Purpose: 
        Let the user answer: “Which model is best for this task?”

    Logic:

        Map models to capability tags (e.g., “OCR”, “translation”, “reasoning”, “agentic tasks”)

        Allow search by capability, field, or modality

        Score candidate models by capability + price + performance data

D. Benchmarks Engine

    Purpose: 
        Compare models based on objective metrics.

    Logic:

        Store benchmark types (MMLU, GPQA, image benchmarks, etc.)

        Attach scores to each model

        Compute performance comparisons:
        “Which model is best in reasoning under $X?”

E. Model Equivalency Suggestions

    Purpose: 
        Provide alternatives when users search for a specific model.

    Logic:

        Compare capability vectors

        Compare pricing

        Compare modality support

        Surface “closest matches”
        e.g., “If you like GPT-4.1, try Claude 3.7 or Gemini-2.0 Flash for cheaper.”
